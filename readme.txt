Make money with native video.

== Description ==
Producing TV quality content is time consuming for all sized publishers, and cute cat videos only have a short lifespan.
MavenVX (https://mavenvx.com) brings highly targeted and relevant television quality video content, paired with premium advertisers.

We license video from Reuters, EuroNews, Hollyscoop, Gastrolab, Fashion Wire and hundreds of other creators, and monetise this video on your behalf with our advertising partners.

Benefits of using MavenVX:

1. Increase time on site by minutes (not seconds!)

2. Bring licensed, TV quality video - so that you don't have to worry about editing & curating

3. Automate the process of inserting relevant video into your content

4. Constantly keep adding new, up to date video to keep your readers engaged

5. Monetize with our premium advertising partners (you keep 60% of earned revenue)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is MavenVX? =

MavenVX automatically analyzes your text content to recommend videos that are personalized for your readers. We embed related videos directly into your content, and are particularly well suited for blogs/publishers that focus on entertainment, lifestyle, fashion, health & beauty.

= What if my site is not related to entertainment/lifestyle/fashion/health & beauty? =

We are happy for anyone to [sign-up](https://mavenvx.com), as we continously add new content, but you might not see video recommendations, until we have something related.

= What happens if the MavenVX service is unavailable? =

The MavenVX platform is monitored 24/7. In the unlikely event there is a service outage, we do not insert any video recommendations into the content. The end reader of your site will not experience any disruption to their reading experience.

= Is there any cost in signing up? =

It's free to sign-up to MavenVX. Once approved you will be able to start generating revenue. We pay out on revenues over US $100 on a NET30 basis.

= Wouldn't it be easier if I embedded the videos myself? =

The problem with this manual approach is that it's time consuming. Also, embedding a video (from say, YouTube) means you miss out on the revenue earned, which goes to Google, not You.

Our technology is smart enough to create video recommendations that are relevant
to the content and we keep our video library fresh. Plus we bring a huge pool of advertisers and monetize the video on your behalf.

= I have more questions =
